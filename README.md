# That's a LOT of zombies
- This is my entry for Bevy Jam 2023. The theme of the jam was "That's a LOT of entities".
- The code in the repo isn't refactored as this is a last mintue submission. I'll need to clean it up at some point.

- Try out the game on itch - https://bones-ai.itch.io/thats-a-lot-of-zombies

Built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine
