# That's a LOT of zombies
This is my entry for Bevy Jam 2023. The theme of the jam was "That's a LOT of entities".
The code in the repo isn't refactored as this is a last mintue submission. I'll need to clean it up at some point.

Built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine
